# Velero Example Plugins

![Build Status][1]

This repository contains example plugins for Velero.

## Kinds of Plugins

Velero currently supports the following kinds of plugins:

- **Object Store** - persists and retrieves backups, backup log files, restore warning/error files, restore logs.
- **Volume Snapshotter** - creates snapshots from volumes (during a backup) and volumes from snapshots (during a restore).
- **Backup Item Action** - performs arbitrary logic on individual items prior to storing them in the backup file.
- **Restore Item Action** - performs arbitrary logic on individual items prior to restoring them in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Delete Item Action** - performs arbitrary logic on individual items prior to deleting them from the backup file.
- **Item Block Action** - executes arbitrary logic for individual items to determine which items should be backed up together

Velero can host multiple plugins inside of a single, resumable process. The plugins can be of any supported type. See `main.go`.

For more information, please see the full [plugin documentation](https://velero.io/docs/main/overview-plugins/).

## Building the plugins

To build the plugins, run

```bash
$ make
```

To build the image, run

```bash
$ make container
```

This builds an image tagged as `velero/velero-plugin-example:main`. If you want to specify a different name or version/tag, run:

```bash
$ IMAGE=your-repo/your-name VERSION=your-version-tag make container 
```

## Deploying the plugins

To deploy your plugin image to an Velero server:

1. Make sure your image is pushed to a registry that is accessible to your cluster's nodes.
2. Run `velero plugin add <registry/image:version>`. Example with a dockerhub image: `velero plugin add velero/velero-plugin-example`.

## Using the plugins

When the plugin is deployed, it is only made available to use. To make the plugin effective, you must modify your configuration:

Backup storage:

1. Run `kubectl edit backupstoragelocation <location-name> -n <velero-namespace>` e.g. `kubectl edit backupstoragelocation default -n velero` OR `velero backup-location create <location-name> --provider <provider-name>`
2. Change the value of `spec.provider` to enable an **Object Store** plugin
3. Save and quit. The plugin will be used for the next `backup/restore`

Volume snapshot storage:

1. Run `kubectl edit volumesnapshotlocation <location-name> -n <velero-namespace>` e.g. `kubectl edit volumesnapshotlocation default -n velero` OR `velero snapshot-location create <location-name> --provider <provider-name>`
2. Change the value of `spec.provider` to enable a **Volume Snapshotter** plugin
3. Save and quit. The plugin will be used for the next `backup/restore`

Backup/Restore/ItemBlock actions:

1. Add the plugin to Velero as described in the Deploying the plugins section.
2. The plugin will be used for the next `backup/restore`.

## Examples

To run with the example plugins, do the following:

1. Run `velero backup-location create  default --provider file` Optional: `--config bucket:<your-bucket>,prefix:<your-prefix>` to configure a bucket and/or prefix directories.
2. Run `velero snapshot-location create example-default --provider example-volume-snapshotter`
3. Run `kubectl edit deployment/velero -n <velero-namespace>`
4. Change the value of `spec.template.spec.args` to look like the following:

```yaml
      - args:
        - server
        - --default-volume-snapshot-locations
        - example-volume-snapshotter:example-default
```

5. Run `kubectl create -f examples/with-pv.yaml` to apply a sample nginx application that uses the example block store plugin. ***Note***: This example works best on a virtual machine, as it uses the host's `/tmp` directory for data storage.
6. Save and quit. The plugins will be used for the next `backup/restore`
7. To see the ItemBlockAction example in action, run `kubectl create -f examples/itemblock-pods.yaml` to apply a sample nginx application that uses the example ItemBlockAction plugin. The example IBA plugin will put both pods in the same itemblock, and you can see this from the sequence of pod hook execution -- both pre hooks run, then after ItemBlock backup, both post hooks run.

## Creating your own plugin project

1. Create a new directory in your `$GOPATH`, e.g. `$GOPATH/src/github.com/someuser/velero-plugins`
2. Copy everything from this project into your new project

```bash
$ cp -a $GOPATH/src/github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-example/* $GOPATH/src/github.com/someuser/velero-plugins/.
```

3. Remove the git history

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/someuser/velero-plugins
$ rm -rf .git
```

4. Adjust the existing plugin directories and source code as needed.

The `Makefile` is configured to automatically build all directories starting with the prefix `velero-`.
You most likely won't need to edit this file, as long as you follow this convention.

If you need to pull in additional dependencies to your vendor directory, just run

```bash
$ make modules
```
